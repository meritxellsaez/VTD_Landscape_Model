MainDA_ClusterDayByDayRef.m performs the clustering of the experiemntal FACS data considered in 
Saez, Blassberg, Camacho-Aguilar et al. 2021. Cell systems.

The names of the datasets are as detailed in the supplementary table T1 included as supplementary 
information with the paper.
Dataset A is the Initial experimental series, Dataset B is the test experimental series and 
Dataset D is the Prediction experimental series relating to the bifurcation of CE. 
No clustering was performed for Dataset C, which relates to the predictions about AN stability.

The code shows plots with the distributions obtained from the pooled reference set of conditions 
(as defined in the paper) and tables with the proportions allocated to each cell state, at each 
time point for each experimental condition. 
The summary of all the proportions is included as supplementary table T2 with the paper.
